  <p> It all began a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. There was a man with a mission...A mission from God! Somehow he had to irritate his brother in the most creative way humanely possible. He tried mailing phalic shaped-gummy treats, but sadly his brother has a sense of humor and this simply would not do. So the only logical next step would be to spend hours developing a primative webpage expressing how much this man (Landon) loves cats!!!!
